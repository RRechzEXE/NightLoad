NOTE | 1
The stable version of the app has been released. The errors that may occur in this version are most likely a problem caused by the servers of the file you are going to download. However, if you think there is a problem caused by the application, come to the telegram support channel with the logs in the download_logs.txt file in the BasicDownload\src directory and declare the problems.

Initially, the app was designed for Windwos 10 (32/64) and Windows 11. Not tested for Windows 7 or old version operating systems. However, it should work when Python or Python3 is installed. If it works, please let me know in the Telegram Support Channel!
