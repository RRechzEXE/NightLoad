Project NightLoad: Open Source Project with Aria2

Built on aria2 resources, NightLoad takes you away from the complex terminal usage of aria2 and moves you to a simpler, faster, and easier-to-use interface. This way, you only need to add the URL and press the Download button!

Supported OS;
Windows 8.1 (32/64-Bit)
Windows 10 (32/64-Bit)
Windows 11

Project NightLoad Features;
1- Ultra-Fast Downloading: Download without buffering using Aria2's download logic!
2- Thread/Parallel Download: It allows you to download faster by dividing the file you are going to download into several parts. You can enter the number of tracks manually. (Default 4)
3- Light and Dark Themes: Since we aim for a more modern design, choose the Light or Dark theme according to your system theme! The choice is yours...
4- Mainly Aria2 features: Since it's basically built on Aria2, it can do pretty much all of what aria2 can do. Including the sites that Aria2 supports!

NOTE | 1
The stable version of the app has been released. The errors that may occur in this version are most likely a problem caused by the servers of the file you are going to download. However, if you think there is a problem caused by the application, come to the telegram support channel with the logs in the download_logs.txt file in the BasicDownload\src directory and declare the problems.

NOTE | 2
Initially, the app was designed for Windwos 10 (32/64) and Windows 11. Not tested for Windows 7 or old version operating systems. However, it should work when Python or Python3 is installed. If it works, please let me know in the Telegram Support Channel!

NOTE | 3
This project is now complete. It won't be getting any updates in the future! (Latest version v4.1.0) If Aria2 is updated, replace the aria2 files in the .zip with the new version.
