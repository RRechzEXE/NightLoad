BasicDownload/NightLoad with Aria2 is still in BETA. In some cases, this can be caused by errors or incomplete/unfinished file download issues. These problems will be corrected in the future.

Initially, the app was designed for Windwos 10 (32/64) and Windows 11. Not tested for Windows 7/8/8.1 operating systems. However, it should work when Python or Python3 is installed. If it works, please let me know in the Telegram Support Channel!
