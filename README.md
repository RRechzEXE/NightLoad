NOTE | 2
NightLoad with Aria2 is still in BETA. In some cases, this can be caused by errors or incomplete/unfinished file download issues. These problems will be corrected in the future.

NOTE | 3
Initially, the app was designed for Windwos 10 (32/64) and Windows 11. Not tested for Windows 7/8/8.1 operating systems. However, it should work when Python or Python3 is installed. If it works, please let me know in the Telegram Support Channel!

NOTE | 4
Currently, only Turkish is supported. Other languages will be added in the future.

NOTE | 5
The app is still in BETA, so it is not recommended to download files such as ISO or ZIP!!
